                        <p>Our civil justice system is designed to compensate innocent victims of carelessness and violations of safety codes when they become injured as a result. No one can take away the pain and suffering that an innocent victim may experience; however our legal system does attempt to compensate victims by payment of money damages.
If you are a victim of an accident, or are injured due to the negligence of another, you may be entitled to a cash award, health care benefits and other compensation. Our Personal Injury Counsel can assist you with all types of negligence cases, including auto and transit accidents, construction accidents, slip and fall injuries and wrongful death claims, among others. Most injury claims are subject to strict time limits, it is important to obtain legal advice as soon as possible. In some cases, such as no-fault, or claims against certain governmental entities, notices of claim must be filed in as few as 30 days of an injury. So if you are injured, you should promptly consult with our law firm to determine your rights.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Whether you’re a passenger, driver, or pedestrian, if you are injured in an auto or transit accident you may be entitled to multiple forms of compensation. Regardless of fault, most injured persons are entitled to lost earnings and medical coverage through no-fault insurance. In addition, if you have sustained a serious injury, you may be entitled to compensation for the pain and suffering endured. Your spouse may be also entitled to a claim for “loss of services”. It is important that you seek legal counsel immediately whenever you have been involved in an accident.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Workers injured on or around a construction site may be entitled to make a third party negligence claim against the party liable for the injury, usually a general contractor or property owner. In addition to receiving Workers’ Compensation and Social Security Disability Benefits, injured construction workers may be entitled to further compensation under the safe workplace provisions of the Labor Law. Ladder, scaffold, defective machinery, and unsafe workplace claims may have enormous potential monetary value, so it is important to obtain appropriate and timely advice.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Some of the most common types of personal injury lawsuits involve slip and fall accidents caused by unsafe buildings, sidewalks and roadways. Property owners, lessees, building managers, and maintenance companies are responsible for constructing and maintaining their property safely. Municipalities are similarly charged with proper maintenance of roadways and sidewalks. If these parties are negligent, and their negligence causes you to be injured, they can be held liable for your pain, suffering, and immediate and future loss of wages.

                      <li>Sadly, the negligence of others can sometimes result in the untimely death of an innocent victim. The responsible party can be held liable by the estate of the victim for conscious pain and suffering and loss of future earnings and other economic loss. For example, if the head of a household who is responsible for most of a family’s income is killed as the result of another party’s negligence, his or her family may be entitled to substantial cash recoveries. It is important that the family seek proper legal counsel immediately.
