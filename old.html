                    <ul>
                      <li>Whether you’re a passenger, driver, or pedestrian, if you are injured in an auto or transit accident you may be entitled to multiple forms of compensation. Regardless of fault, most injured persons are entitled to lost earnings and medical coverage through no-fault insurance. In addition, if you have sustained a serious injury, you may be entitled to compensation for the pain and suffering endured. Your spouse may be also entitled to a claim for “loss of services”. It is important that you seek legal counsel immediately whenever you have been involved in an accident.

                      <li>Workers injured on or around a construction site may be entitled to make a third party negligence claim against the party liable for the injury, usually a general contractor or property owner. In addition to receiving Workers’ Compensation and Social Security Disability Benefits, injured construction workers may be entitled to further compensation under the safe workplace provisions of the Labor Law. Ladder, scaffold, defective machinery, and unsafe workplace claims may have enormous potential monetary value, so it is important to obtain appropriate and timely advice.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Some of the most common types of personal injury lawsuits involve slip and fall accidents caused by unsafe buildings, sidewalks and roadways. Property owners, lessees, building managers, and maintenance companies are responsible for constructing and maintaining their property safely. Municipalities are similarly charged with proper maintenance of roadways and sidewalks. If these parties are negligent, and their negligence causes you to be injured, they can be held liable for your pain, suffering, and immediate and future loss of wages.

                      <li>Sadly, the negligence of others can sometimes result in the untimely death of an innocent victim. The responsible party can be held liable by the estate of the victim for conscious pain and suffering and loss of future earnings and other economic loss. For example, if the head of a household who is responsible for most of a family’s income is killed as the result of another party’s negligence, his or her family may be entitled to substantial cash recoveries. It is important that the family seek proper legal counsel immediately.

                  <li><a href="#">LEAD POISONING</a>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Lead poisoning most often occurs when young children (toddlers) start crawling around the home and get lead dust on their hands. These children then engage in normal hand-to-mouth activity and it is this activity during which the child actually becomes lead poisoned. More severe cases may involve pica where children actually eat lead based paint chips. By far the most common source of lead poisoning in children is deteriorating lead based paint in older homes.
<br><br>
THE INJURIES CAUSED BY LEAD POISONING
<br><br>
The greatest risk of injury from lead poison is to children under the age of seven, whose developing bodies and brains are sensitive to even small amounts of lead, which can leave children with irreversible neurological injury that does not appear until many years after exposure to lead. The kinds of injuries lead causes in children include: Learning disabilities, Brain damage (sometimes subtle), Loss of IQ Points and Intellect, Academic failure, Neuropsychological deficits, Attention Deficit Disorder, Hyperactive behavior, Antisocial (criminal) behavior, Neurological problems, Encephalopathy (brain swelling), Major Organ FailureComa and Death.

These injuries can be life-threatening or can prevent a child from realizing his or her scholastic, vocational, and financial potential, or from becoming self-sufficient adult. Studies have shown 
that lead poisoned children are more likely to drop out of high school and to live a lifetime of 
unemployment. Lead poisoning can take important abilities from a child.
<br><br>HAS YOUR CHILD BEEN LEAD POISONED?<br><br>
Very often parents are not aware if their child has been lead poisoned for a number of reasons: 
<br>
1.  The definition of lead poisoning has decreased from 60 ug/dl to 10 ug/dl. Older children with lead levels of under 25 were not considered lead poisoned. <br>
2. The Dept. of Health of most municipalities has set 20 ug/dl as their action level. That is to say, they will not intervene when a child’s blood lead levels are between 10 and 19 ug/dl, even though the child is lead poisoned. <br>
3. Although some health care providers are diligent about screening for lead and properly advising parents, unfortunately others are not. This has resulted in the failure of children to be screened for lead poisoning at ages 6 months to a year as required by the Guidelines set down in the Center for Disease Control Statement of October 1991. Follow-up screening is, sadly, also not undertaken in many cases. 
<br><br>
If your child has demonstrated learning disabilities, loss of cognition, and unexplainable low IQ, you should consider that lead poisoning may have been a contributing factor to these problems. The Law Office of Harlan A. Platz, P.L.L.C. in a meritorious case will undertake to accumulate the child’s medical and school records and have them reviewed by doctors knowledgeable in the effects of lead poisoning in children.

                  <li><a href="#">MEDICAL MALPRACTICE</a>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Physicians, nurses and other health care providers are human; they can, and do, make mistakes. Medical malpractice is the failure of a health care provider -- usually a doctor, hospital, or health care institution -- to provide a patient with treatment that satisfies the customary standard of care provided by the medical industry. In order to bring a successful action, that failure to measure up to the standard of care must result in an injury to the patient; and it must be a substantial cause of the injury. If you think you or a loved one is the victim of medical malpractice, please contact us. In order to successfully pursue a New York medical malpractice claim, a patient must prove that a health care provider either failed to do something which a reasonably prudent health care provider would have done, or that (s)he did something that should not have been done; and that failure or action caused injury to the patient. Although doctors and hospital administrators often complain about “frivolous” litigation, the plain fact is that in New York, every case that is successful is supported by reports and/or testimony of medical doctors who are critical of the treatment that the patient received.
<br><br>
What makes a Good Case?
<br><br>
Obviously, a departure from good and accepted care by the doctor, hospital, midwife or nurse is a prerequisite for bringing a medical malpractice case. Causation is also necessary. That is, the departure must have caused the injury, which the plaintiff claims. However, in order to bring a viable case for medical malpractice, the injury must be severe and permanent. The reason is that medical negligent cases are costly to prosecute. The Law Office of Harlan A. Platz, P.L.L.C.  in a meritorious case will undertake to accumulate the medical records and have them reviewed by doctors knowledgeable in their area of expertise.

                      <li>Churning in stock accounts is a form of investment fraud that involves the excessive transaction of your investment account's securities by your broker without regard for your financial objectives in order to generate commissions. Profitability is not a defense to churning a portfolio, however. If it were, a financial advisor could churn with impunity up to the gains of the portfolio. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) prohibits the practice of churning and provides a securities arbitration process through which investors can seek to recover losses and illicit commissions. A successful churning claim requires proving that your broker had control or de-facto control of your investment account transactions and conducted transactions that were excessive in relation to your investment objectives, resources and risk tolerance and without regard for your best interests. Churning in stock accounts can be established using various methods, including calculations that can help determine whether a broker's transactions meet the definition of excessive. These calculations include assessing the commission-to-equity ratio and turnover rate securities in your investment account.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Investment firms have a responsibility to establish and maintain rules regarding the supervision of their registered financial advisors and brokers. The supervision includes regular reviews of your portfolio to ensure it meets your investment objectives and risk tolerance. Broker-dealers are required to contact you in response to red flags to ensure you understand the risks involved with your holdings or trading strategy. If your investments lost money due to a representative's negligent or fraudulent behavior and the firm's failure to supervise played a role, we may be able to help you recover your losses.

                    <ul>
                      <li style="font-size:1em;">Many investors fall prey to the unethical practices of brokers who put their own interests above those of their clients. Common fraudulent investment products and scams include:
<br><br>Non-Traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): investors in non-traded REITs must rely on disclosures made by the sponsor of the REIT while paying high commissions. These investments are illiquid, expense, and often underperform compared to REITs traded on an open exchange.
<br><br>Junk Bonds: junk bonds are rated below investment grade by S&P and Moody's. They carry a high risk of default and are not suitable for investors seeking stable investments.
<br><br>PonziSchemes: these schemes promise high returns, but use money from new investors to pay earlier investors.
<br><br>Structured Notes: a hybrid security product that generally includes a stock or bond plus a derivative. They may include hidden costs and are often riskier than promised to investors.
<br><br>Variable annuities: investors pay high commissions and costs for these products with high 
penalties for liquidating. They are often not suitable for the elderly investors to whom they are 
recommended.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li> 
                  <li><a href="#" style="font-size:1em;">Margin Trading</a>
                    <ul>
                      <li style="font-size:1em;">A "margin" account is a brokerage account in which the brokerage firm loans money to the investor. While margin investing can double the gains on an investment, it also doubles the risk. In fact, because Interest immediately begins to be charged to the account and a temporary drop in the stock value can cause liquidation, the danger is even greater than many investors realize. Margin accounts are very profitable for brokerage firms. Brokers sometimes get a bonus on interest charged to their clients' accounts, but their goal Is usually to double commissions. When management fees are charged instead of commissions, these fees are charged on the portfolio size rather than the client's "equity" in the account. Thus, in addition to interest costs, commissions and fees double in margin accounts. Using margin is a high risk method of investing and is only appropriate for sophisticated investors who fully understand the risk.

                    <ul>
                      <li style="font-size:1em;">A brokerage firm or broker can be held liable if that firm, or broker misrepresents material facts or omits to disclose material facts to the investor regarding an Investment, and that client subsequently loses money on that investment. Often the misrepresentations or omissions disguise the risk associated with a particular investment. A broker has a duty to fairly disclose all of the risks associated with an investment.

                  <li><a href="#" style="font-size:1em;">Overconcentration of Assets</a>
                    <ul>
                      <li style="font-size:1em;">One of the most important rules of investing is diversification. If a broker concentrates your portfolio in any individual investment or type of investment, then the risk of losses with that portfolio is dramatically increased. It’s the old adage that it is unwise to place all of your "Investment” eggs in one basket. A broker Who does not diversify his client's portfolio is potentially liable if that investment declines in value.

                  </li>    
                  <li><a href="#" style="font-size:1em;">Unauthorized Trading</a>
                    <ul>
                      <li style="font-size:1em;">Unauthorized trading is a common form of investment fraud in which a financial advisor or broker makes transactions via your nondiscretionary investment account without your explicit permission. Unauthorized trading often involves the practice of churning, in which a broker engages in an excessive level of transactions through a customer's account. This generates substantial commissions for financial advisors and brokers, but it also costs investors. Most investors maintain nondiscretionary accounts with their investment firms. In a nondiscretionary approach, your financial advisor or broker may make investment recommendations but may not make transactions linked to your investments without your consent. Other investors choose to have discretionary investment accounts, which are managed by a financial advisor or broker who is authorized in writing by the investor to make decisions regarding the purchase or sale of securities. Financial managers of discretionary accounts still have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of and according to the investment goals and risk tolerance of their investors.
